hello hi, how are you? this is a very simple (my first attempt at backend) website for dog adoption. it hypothetically does the following things:

1) a home page with random images of dogs that change on refresh
2) dynamic routing based on dog breeds with pages that display a pictures of that breed
3) a table for admins to keep track of dogs still open for adoption (connected to Supabase), still working on all the CRUD hahaha...

anyway, the some things to keep in mind before you actually look at the webiste:

1) the logout button is kind of goofy and only appears on the home page
2) once you sign-in, any time after when you click the sign-in button on the header, it takes you straight to admin
3) there's probably more goofy stuff...

but yeah, it was fun.
